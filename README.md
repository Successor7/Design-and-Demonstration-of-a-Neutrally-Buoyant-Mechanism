# Design and Demonstration of a Neutrally Buoyant Mechanism  

**Duration**: Aug 2024 – Nov 2024  
**Supervisor**: Dr. Chander Shekhar Sharma    

## Overview  
This project involved designing and implementing a neutrally buoyant object capable of precise depth control in water. The mechanism utilizes PVC pipes and submersible water pumps to achieve controlled ascent, descent, and stable neutral buoyancy while demonstrating resilience to water disturbances.  

## Key Features  
- **Buoyancy Control**: Achieved precise adjustments using submersible water pumps for intake and expulsion of water, ensuring stable depth maintenance.  
- **Dynamic Stability**: Integrated fluid mechanics principles, including Archimedes’ principle, for effective depth control under varying conditions.  
- **Performance Optimization**: Addressed issues like twisting and lateral drift through weight balancing, achieving consistent depth stabilization with an accuracy of ±5 cm.  

## Learning Outcomes  
- Gained hands-on experience in applying fluid mechanics principles to design functional prototypes.  
- Developed skills in integrating mechanical components with hydraulic systems for real-world applications.  
- Improved problem-solving by optimizing system performance for enhanced stability and accuracy.  

## Applications  
This system has potential applications in underwater robotics, research, and environmental monitoring, where precise depth control is essential.
